       - Communication effectiveness
       End the summary with a clear tone about whether they are a **strong**, **average**, or **weak** fit.

    2. KEY STRENGTHS: List 6–8 **specific, evidence-based strengths** the candidate demonstrated. 
        - Only include strengths if they are clearly supported by the evaluation log 
            (e.g., knowledge rating ≥ 6/10, "strong" responses, confident/enthusiastic tone, or concrete examples mentioned). 
        - Where possible, link the strength to how it can be leveraged to improve weaker areas 
            (e.g., “Strong communication in casual answers — could apply this clarity to technical explanations”). 
        - If no strong evidence exists, explicitly state: 
            "No significant strengths were demonstrated due to vague or non-specific responses."
        - Avoid generic filler like "professional demeanor" unless clearly evident.

    3. IMPROVEMENT AREAS: List 6–8 **concrete, actionable improvement areas**. 
        - Tie each point directly to weaknesses in the evaluation log 
            (e.g., ratings < 5/10, multiple "weak/confused" responses, nervous/unsure emotional tone). 
        - Provide specific guidance on how to improve (e.g., “Instead of one-word answers, provide examples of projects to show depth”). 
        - If performance was consistently weak, you may state: 
            "The candidate should significantly improve technical depth, communication clarity, and confidence before reapplying."
